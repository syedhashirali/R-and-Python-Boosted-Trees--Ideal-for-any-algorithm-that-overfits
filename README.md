# R-and-Python-Boosted-Trees--Ideal-for-any-algorithm-that-overfits
In this project I demonstrate how R tree library and Python Scikit-learn can be used to create, prune, post-prune, cross validate and eventually boost decision trees to greatly increase accuracy, decrease over-fitting and improve model generalization.
